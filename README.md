### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cheolmin.Ryu.

I'm a back-end developer who loves to make web applications. However, I usually make front-end source code with it as well. I majored in Computer Science in university. I worked as a web developer or a cloud architect for more than 10 years in companies in Korea. Nowadays, Iâ€™m interested in MLOps architectures.
